# Object oriented Java Script exercisses.

## What's this?

This are few exercises made on bootcamp Kodilla.

## Technologies

- HTML
- SCSS
- Vanilla JS
- NPM scripts: browser-sync, nu-html-checker, globster, rim-raf. See more in package.json if you want.

## How to run

- Download project from my github and unpack.
- Open in terminal and type: <code>git tree --all</code> to see branches.
- You can switch between exercisses by changing branches.
- When you choose branch you want. Open in your web browser index.html file.


## Functionality

### Branch 11.1

There is just a introduction into OOP in js. This is fake mobile phone software.
Open index.html and go into console.

### Branch 11.2

This is simple script about context of 'this' in js. Nothing special. Very basic stuff

### Branch 11.3

This is basic skeleton of Kanban App that you can see [here](https://mariuszszlachta.github.io/Kanban-1/).
This basic version doesn't use Kodilla's api and doesn't save any data in localstorage etc.
